# NestJS-NATS-Microservices

This project demonstrates how to create a microservice architecture using NestJS, MySQL, Docker, and NATS.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your machine:
- **Node.js**
- **Docker**
- **Docker Compose**

## Tools Overview

### NestJS
NestJS is a progressive Node.js framework for building efficient and scalable server-side applications.

## Project Structure

This project includes the following microservices and components:
- **`http-api-gateway`**: Handles routing and serves as the entry point for the microservices.
- **`users-microservice`**: Manages user-related operations.
- **`payments-microservice`**: Handles payment processing.

## Running the Project Locally

1. **Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed** on your machine.

2. **Build and start all services** (including microservices, MySQL, and NATS) with Docker Compose:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```
    This command will spin up the `http-api-gateway`, `users-microservice`, `payments-microservice`, as well as the MySQL and NATS services.

3. **Verify the setup** by checking the logs and ensuring that all services are running correctly.

## Conclusion

This setup provides a complete microservice architecture using NestJS, MySQL, Docker, and NATS. Customize and extend it to fit your specific application requirements.
